# Chord recognition in audio files using TensorflowJS
Experiments with AI Music Processing in TensorflowJS

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an in browser application that can recognize played chords in audio files, without any line of backend code.
Therefore TensorflowJS will be used to import a pretrained model from keras that predicts a chord sequence based on a sequence of chroma features.
The preprocessing of the audio files is done in javascript, too.
